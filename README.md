# SpiralEngineLib
Simple Game Engine Library written in Java.

SpiralEngineLib will be built upon LWJGL as a practice project. It will feature CoreEngine, Rooms (Play areas for 2D/3D renderings), Various Nodes (Used to build game objects to use in the Rooms), and Scripts (Abstract Class meant to be extended upon to give functionality to rooms and nodes)

I plan to start out with 2D game functionality and work to 3D. Then move on to networked play.
